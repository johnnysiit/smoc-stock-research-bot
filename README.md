# SMOC Finance Report Automatic Process System (FRAPS)
## Introduction:
This program is designed for professional financial analysts. By using this program, financial analysts can quickly obtain basic data, valuation models, and even stock picks

All calculations that can be filled mechanically, valuations, and ratings will be included in this program.
The analyst will only need to enter the ticker symbol of the stock and will get all the important information about the company, financial statements, financial analysis, valuations, ratings and some important information. And the collected data will be cleaned, organized, and exported to the user.

This program is initially planned to be used as a supplementary tool for financial analysts. Our goal in this program is **NOT** to replace the job of analysts, but to act as an assistant to them. For those who are interested in this and want to make FRAPS more useful, please contact me and join our SMOC development team.

Thank you for using our FRAPS.
