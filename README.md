# SMOC Finance Report Automatic Process System (FRAPS)
## Introduction:
This program is designed for financial investigators.

All calculations that can be filled and rated mechanically will be included in this program.
The analyst only needs to enter the ticker symbol of the stock to get all the important information about the company, financial statements, financial analysis, ratings, and some basic content. And the collected data will be cleaned, organized, and exported to the user.

This program is initially planned to be used as a supplementary program for financial analysts. Our goal in this program is **NOT** to work stock prediction, but to act as an assistant to them. For those who are interested in this and want to make FRAPS more useful, please contact me to join our SMOC development team.

Thank you for using our FRAPS.
